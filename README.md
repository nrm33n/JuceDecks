# JuceDecks

Uses the C++ <a href="https://juce.com/">JUCE</a> framework for a music mixing app with a mixing deck GUI. Allows users to load audio 
files into a playlist, which are parsed for length, song name, and artist. Rewind, fast forward, play, and pause each track independently. The volume, speed, and position of each song can also be independently changed around using a slider or values can be manually input.
