# JuceDecks

files into a playlist, which are parsed for length, song name, and artist. Rewind, fast forward, play, and pause each track independently. The volume, speed, and position of each song can also be independently changed around. 
This can be done using a slider or a value can be added manually in the value field. 

The UI looks like this:
