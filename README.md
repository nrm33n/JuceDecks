# JuceDecks

Here, I'm using the <a href="https://juce.com/">JUCE</a> framework for C++ to create a music mixing application with a mixing deck UI. It allows the user to load audio 
files into a playlist, parses those files for length, song name, and artist. 

Users can rewind, fast forward, play, and pause each file independently. The volume, speed, and position of each song can also be independently changed around. 
This can be done using a slider or a value can be added manually in the value field. 

The UI is quite basic and looks like this:
